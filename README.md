# Static-Site-Generator
Just another static site generator. Very much a work in progress. Eventual goal is to use this for [my website](http://jamesstuber.com)

Usage:  
$ mkdir ~/my-new-blog  
$ cd ~/my-new blog  
$ python ~/Code/static-site.py bootstrap  
Generates site structure  

$ python ~/Code/static-site.py generate  
Converts entries in /content to html and moves them to /output
